Compilation 
You must have a c++ compiler on your computer!
go to the folder containing the files Driver.cpp, header.cpp, header.h in the terminal and write

"g++ Driver.cpp header.cpp -std=c++17 -o APE"

this will compile the program

then if on windows write
APE n m

if on linex 
./APE n m

NOTE 
n is a number between 1 -10, it represents the electorates 
m is a number between 1 - 30, it represnets the days the campaign goes on for
anything outside of the above numbers will throw an error!

if these of more numbers are put in it will also throw an error!
