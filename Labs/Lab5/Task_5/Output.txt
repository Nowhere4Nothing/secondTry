template <typename T>
T funcExp (T list[], int size) {
    int j;
    T x = list[0];
    T y = list[size - 1];
	
uses a templete to get some inputs (one list and an int)
it then makes 2 templetes with variables of list[index 0]
and a templete with varibale y list [indext of the int size -0] (size is 8 passed from the main)

for (j = 1; j < (size - 1) /2; j++) {
        if (x < list[j]) {
            x = list[j];
        }
        if (y > list[size - 1 - j]) {
            y = list[size - 1 -j];
        }
    }
	
this for loop takes the size (8 - 1) / 2 and loops 4 times
then the if statment says that if x (0) is less than list [j] (j 0 to 4)
then x will = the j when the if statement is true

then the next if says y has to be greater than (list[8 - 1 - whatever j is in hte loop]) then
y will = the above if statement

then you return x and y together

 int main() {
    int list [8] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8};
    string strList[] = {"one", "fish", "two", "fish", "red", "fish", "blue", "fish"};

    cout << funcExp(list, 8) << " :: " << funcExp(strList, 8) << endl;
}
the main just gets the lists 

then it outputs the the templete with the chosen list and an int number (size) 
so it outputs

9 :: twoblue
9 is just 2 ints added together, then displayed

two blue being the indext that the for loop and if statement landed on then plused together as they are both strings they end up lie that
